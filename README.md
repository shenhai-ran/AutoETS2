# InternPilot
Development of autonomous driving system for Euro Truck Simulator 2.

## Introduction
This project aims to build an autonomous driving system using the InternLM for truck driving in the Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2).
By combining the powerful natural language and vision processing capabilities of the InternLM/InternVL with the gaming environment of ETS2, I hope to achieve an intelligent assistant that can automatically complete game tasks.

This is a project for InternLM Boostcamp [Season 4](https://github.com/InternLM/Tutorial) ([#2519](https://github.com/InternLM/Tutorial/discussions/2519))
